The Arena-provided branch is fixed as `arena/4fd6bbbb-nfl3`; this session cannot create or switch to a session-named branch. Other sessions should avoid the claimed files and log integration requests here.

## Research and integration log — arena-4fd6bbbb, 2026-11-12 UTC

- Repository review: baseline contained only `README.md`; no existing data or application to verify. No other claims were present when this task was claimed.
- Inspected official [NFL injury report](https://www.nfl.com/injuries/), [NFL statistics](https://www.nfl.com/stats/), [NFL Broncos roster](https://www.nfl.com/teams/denver-broncos/roster), [NWS API documentation](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api), [scikit-learn cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html), and [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages). Selected injury rows were checked against the report; proposals are explicitly labeled, and unknowns are blank.
- The NFL depth-chart URL `/teams/denver-broncos/depth-chart` returned a 404 page. Roster status is not evidence of replacement order. Current injury report is not a historical point-in-time archive. Data rights, market quotes, lineup histories, automated refresh, correlations, validation results, leaderboard rewards and live models are unverified / not implemented; published on Flagged for Review.
- Static integration: `python3 tests/check_site.py` checks local references and external source links in each data row; it passed. This is not an external link crawler or proof that future source content remains unchanged.
- Status: needs review for the above open research and system gaps; the research dashboard itself is ready for static publication. No claims of complete automated tracking or verified profitable strategies are made.
